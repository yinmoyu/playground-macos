# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I'm a ~~dragon lost in human world~~ [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) master's student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). Before that, I got my bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/).

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My research interests lie primarily in exploring the capability of machines to be continual, generalizable and data-efficient, like continual learning, meta-learning and few-shot learning. I also have experience in vision-language learning and video understanding.

I'm also learning to build machine learning softwares and systems. I'm also learning TypeScript, React and Vue.
